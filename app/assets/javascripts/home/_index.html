        <p style="text-indent: 40px">They were friends before they became fiancés and through that friendship, the foundation for what they are today was created. Meghan and Ryan first met in high school and although they said "hi" in the hallway and flirted in class, they certainly didn’t anticipate ever planning a wedding together.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 40px">After high school, the two left for college and occasionally saw one another between semesters, but it was not until after college that things really began to take shape. In May of 2013 Ryan graduated, a Bulldog from Bryant University, and Meghan, a Fightin’ Blue Hen from the University of Delaware. Their initial careers brought them both to Boston and this was the case for many of their friends as well. Through numerous get togethers on Landsdowne Street, visits to Tavern in the Square, and hangouts at the Harp, Ryan finally got the courage to ask Meghan out on a date.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 40px">They had always enjoyed one another’s company and it was not until that first date at a Mexican restaurant on Boylston Street that things began to take off. Since that night, the two have not looked back. They have shared ups, downs, highs, and lows, but are so thankful for all of it, because it was all of those experiences that molded the relationship they share today and the life they have to look forward to. It was on August 11th, 2016, after dinner in Seaport, that Ryan proposed to Meghan. That night was just one of many moments to come that the two will never forget.</p>
